This repo contains bash and python scripts for medical image processing.

Scripts are aimed at data cleaning and multi-atlas segmentation. 

Specifically, Segmentation pipelines are contained in med_im_proc_python_bash/python_scripts/segmentation_pipelines

Segmentation is two step: 

1) Classifier is trained. See FemkePROOF_TrainClassifier_LEFT_norm.py

2) Segment structure. See FemkePROOF_Segm_L_T0_lateralmedialmen_oneclassifier.py
